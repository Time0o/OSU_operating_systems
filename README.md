# Oregon State University _Operating Systems_ assignment solutions

I have never taken this course but I found the assignments interesting, they
consist of the following:

## Assignment 1 (`matrix`)

A bash script that performs common matrix operations. After compilation
(`cd matrix; make`), execute `./bin/matrix` without any arguments to display a
usage message.

## Assignment 2 (`adventure`)

A very simple text adventure game that creates a labyrinth of rooms and saves
and loads them to and from text files. After compilation (`cd adventure;
make`), just run `./bin/adventure`, intermediate files are saved to a newly
created directory in the current working directory.

## Assignment 3 (`one_time_pad`)

A set of client server programs which implement the one-time-pad encryption
scheme. Compile with `cd one_time_pad; make`. Then generate a random key of
length greater than a plaintext to be encoded with `./bin/keygen KEY_LENGTH`,
then start encryption and decyption server and assign them to free ports of
your choice with `./bin/otp_enc_d PORT_ENC &`, `./bin/otp_dec_d PORT_DEC &`.
Afterwards encrypt arbitrary plaintext and decrypt them again with
`./bin/otp_enc PLAINTEXT_FILE KEY_FILE PORT_ENC` and `./bin/otp_dec
CIPHERTEXT_FILE KEY_FILE PORT_DEC` where `PLAINTEXT_FILE` must only contain
uppercase letters and spaces and `KEY_FILE` was generated by `./bin/keygen`.
Also make sure that the ports match.
